In relation to this project, I have spent the last month learning the fundamentals of electronics as well as how to use an Arduino Uno board and a variety of sensors with it. It was time to create a project now that my foundation was established. I started by sending commands to the Arduino using the built-in serial monitor in the IDE. I utilised ultrasonic sensor and Interface sensors to detect the item it should follow.
How to do this project:
Assemble the necessary parts, such as an Arduino, Dc geared motors with wheels, IR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, motor driver shields,  jumper wires, 9-volt batteries, etc. then modify it in to a car like look. now  the next step is to place the sensors on the car. then connect the arduino and the motor driver and complete the connections. finally write the code accordingly and thhen upload it. The IDE used here is Arduine IDE.
